# Decimate Product Contract

Decimate is a Rust-native codebase intelligence tool for Dart and Flutter.
It analyzes repositories as module graphs, not as a linter or type checker.

## Principles

- Treat Dart code as graph data: files, declarations, imports, exports, parts,
  and library augmentations.
- Do not evaluate variables, types, or inner function logic.
- Keep outputs deterministic and agent-readable.
- Prefer fast structural parsing over semantic analysis.

## AI Drift Goal

Decimate exists for the same product problem Fallow targets: AI can create code
quickly, but teams still need deterministic evidence to review it, clean it up,
and keep architecture from drifting. For Dart and Flutter, that means:

- finding dead files, unused symbols, duplicate implementation patterns, and
  stale suppressions before they become permanent;
- showing dependency, re-export, boundary, and route-graph risks with paths and
  line numbers;
- ranking hotspots and PR risk so reviewers spend attention where change is most
  likely to matter;
- producing structured JSON, traces, schemas, and MCP tools that agents can use
  before proposing safe cleanup.

Decimate must stay objective and graph/intelligence-focused. It must not enforce
team-specific Flutter style preferences such as generated Riverpod ownership.

## Phase Scope

Phase 1 extracts syntax facts from one `.dart` file:

- `import` directives
- `export` directives
- import/export `show` and `hide` combinators
- import prefixes and deferred import markers
- `part` directives
- `library augment` directives
- all branch URIs from conditional imports and exports, including
  `dart.library.*` branch guards
- top-level class, mixin, extension, and extension type declarations
- top-level enum declarations
- top-level typedef declarations
- top-level variable declarations
- top-level function-like declarations
- class-like member declarations for fields, constructors, getters, setters,
  methods, operators, and enum constants
- syntactic identifier and type-identifier references, excluding directive
  metadata and obvious declaration-name positions

Phase 2 builds a directed module graph:

- nodes are Dart files
- edges are resolved `import`, `export`, `part`, and `library augment`
  dependencies
- dependency edges preserve import prefixes, deferred markers, and `show`/`hide`
  combinators for later symbol visibility propagation
- `part` and `library augment` directives are modeled as file dependencies
- conditional import/export branches are modeled as possible file dependencies
  by default, and `--dart-platform vm|web` can select the target-specific
  compile graph
- relative URIs resolve from the importing file's directory
- `package:` URIs prefer Pub's `.dart_tool/package_config.json` when present,
  including `rootUri` and `packageUri`
- `package:` URIs resolve to local pub workspace/path packages when present
- scan roots expand through local path dependencies and pub workspace members

Phase 3 runs graph intelligence algorithms:

- dead code reachability from caller-supplied entry points
- first conservative unused-export analysis for reachable public top-level
  declarations with no reachable syntactic references
- conservative unused-member analysis for non-public-api enum constants and
  private class-like fields, getters, setters, and methods
- public library `export` chains count as public API reachability and respect
  `show`/`hide` combinators
- circular dependency detection via strongly connected components
- export-only cycle detection for barrel/re-export loops
- architecture boundary rules over graph edges
- structural Dart health analysis for cyclomatic and cognitive function
  complexity
- feature flag inventory for Dart compile-time environment reads, native
  process-environment gates, Firebase Remote Config calls, and LaunchDarkly-style
  variation calls
- unverified security candidate inventory for hardcoded secrets, cleartext
  transport, TLS bypasses, risky WebView surfaces, process execution, dynamic
  SQL, and plain secret storage

Phase 4 exposes the CLI and agent output contract:

- bare `decimate` as a default `decimate check` over the current directory
- `decimate check`
- `decimate audit`
- `decimate review`
- `decimate decision-surface`
- `decimate dead-code`
- `decimate cycles`
- `decimate dupes`
- `decimate health`
- `decimate flags`
- `decimate security`
- `decimate trace`
- `decimate trace-file`
- `decimate trace-symbol`
- `decimate trace-dependency`
- `decimate trace-clone`
- `decimate inspect`
- `decimate list`
- `decimate workspaces`
- `decimate explain`
- `decimate fix`
- `decimate init`
- `decimate hooks`
- `decimate impact`
- `decimate ci-template`
- `decimate schema`
- `decimate config`
- `decimate config-schema`
- `decimate report-schema`
- analysis commands with `--format json` emit `decimate.report.v1`
- trace commands with `--format json` emit `decimate.trace.v1`
- `decimate inspect --format json` emits `decimate.inspect.v1`
- `decimate schema --format json` emits `decimate.schema.v1` with commands,
  issue types, schema versions, and an agent task matrix
- `decimate decision-surface --format json --base REF` emits
  `decimate.decision-surface.v1` as an advisory, always-zero review envelope
- `decimate review` and `decimate audit --brief` emit the same advisory
  decision-surface envelope and always exit 0
- `decimate impact --format json --quiet` emits `decimate.impact.v1` as a
  read-only local value report, enabling `.decimate/impact.jsonl` history when
  present
- `decimate init` emits `decimate.init.v1`, writes `.decimaterc`, optionally
  writes `AGENTS.md` with `--agents`, and refuses to overwrite existing files
  unless `--force` is passed
- `decimate hooks status|install|uninstall` emits `decimate.hooks.v1`, manages
  only Decimate-marked Git pre-commit hooks by default, and refuses unmanaged
  hook overwrite/removal unless `--force` is passed
- `decimate ci-template github|gitlab` emits `decimate.ci-template.v1` JSON or
  YAML CI templates; `gitlab --vendor` writes scoped local template files only
  with explicit overwrite via `--force`
- `decimate report-schema --format json` emits the JSON schema for
  analysis reports under `decimate.report.v1`
- process-level command, config, and runtime failures with `--format json` emit
  `{"error":true,"message":"...","exit_code":2}` on stdout instead of plain
  stderr so agents can parse failure states
- `--config PATH` loads `.decimaterc`, `.decimaterc.json`,
  `.decimaterc.jsonc`, `decimate.toml`, or `.decimate.toml` defaults
- `--save-baseline PATH` writes current visible findings to
  `decimate.baseline.v1`
- `--baseline PATH` suppresses findings already captured in a saved baseline
- `--save-regression-baseline PATH` writes current visible finding counts to
  `decimate.regression-baseline.v1`
- `--regression-baseline PATH`, `--fail-on-regression`, and `--tolerance`
  provide count-based regression gates
- `decimate audit` accepts per-analysis baseline inputs with
  `--dead-code-baseline`, `--health-baseline`, and `--dupes-baseline`
- `decimate audit` summary includes `risk_score`, `risk_level`, and
  introduced/pre-existing attribution; `--gate new-only` fails only on
  introduced error findings while keeping related pre-existing findings visible
- JSON findings include paths, line/column locations, `safe_to_delete`, and `actions`
- JSON reports include read-only `next_steps` for trace-before-delete workflows
- `decimate audit --base REF` runs full graph analysis and reports only findings
  anchored to files changed since the Git ref or their related files
- findings respect `// decimate-ignore-next-line ...` and
  `// fallow-ignore-next-line ...` inline suppressions
- simple one-line unused top-level declarations can emit safe
  `remove-declaration` fix actions; multi-line declarations remain trace-only

## Fallow Parity Target

Decimate must become Fallow-equivalent for Dart and Flutter, adapted to Dart
semantics from the official Dart docs:

- Dart libraries are the privacy boundary; identifiers beginning with `_` are
  private to the library.
- `import`, `export`, `part`, and `library augment` directives define the
  module graph.
- `show`, `hide`, prefixes, deferred imports, conditional imports/exports,
  target platform selection, and `part` files affect symbol visibility and
  reachability.
- `pubspec.yaml` owns package dependencies, `dev_dependencies`, and
  `dependency_overrides`.
- Pub workspaces can share dependency resolution across multiple packages.

Parity areas:

- Dead code: unused files, exports, types, enum members, class members, stale
  suppressions, private type leak checks, traces, and safe fix actions.
- Dependency hygiene: unused dependencies, unlisted dependencies, dev/test-only
  placement, dependency overrides, and workspace placement.
- Graph issues: unresolved imports/exports/parts/augmentations, invalid Dart
  `part of` relationships, circular dependencies, re-export cycles, duplicate
  exports, and architecture boundary violations.
- Flutter framework checks: typed and raw GoRouter route path and name
  collisions, private widget classes, top-level widget helper boundaries,
  unused widget constructor parameters, and unrendered widget classes.
- Duplication: strict, mild, weak, and semantic clone detection with traceable
  fingerprints, top-N filtering, and clone tracing.
- Health: cyclomatic/cognitive/CRAP complexity, file scores, hotspots,
  ownership, refactoring targets, coverage gaps, and explanations.
- Audit: changed-code gates, baselines, regression tolerance, CI review
  envelopes, and next-step suggestions.
- Feature flags: env gates, SDK/config flag calls, stale-flag evidence,
  rollout owner review, and top-N flag inventory.
- Fix: dry-run and confirmed apply flows for safe unused exports/dependencies.
- Config: suppressions, workspaces, public packages, cache settings, and
  broader rule-pack controls.
- Onboarding: local init flows for config, CI, and agent instructions.
- Security candidates: deterministic local review candidates for Dart/Flutter
  sinks and hardcoded secrets, never verified vulnerability claims.
- Runtime coverage: local Dart/Flutter coverage ingestion for hot paths,
  cleanup confidence, coverage gaps, and read-only MCP runtime slices;
  cloud/runtime agent capture remains future work.
- Integrations: schema output, CI templates, an MCP stdio server with guarded
  `fix_preview` / `fix_apply`, editor-ready JSON contracts, impact reporting,
  and read-only MCP impact reports.

  `decimate/unused-class-member` findings for reachable Dart libraries,
  including same-library `part` reference handling, suppressions, rule config,
  baselines, and JSON schema coverage
- syntactic reference extraction for identifiers and type identifiers
- a `SymbolIndex` owner plus conservative `decimate/unused-export` and
  `decimate/unused-type` findings for reachable non-entry, non-generated,
  public top-level declarations and typedefs
- Fallow-style `--include-entry-exports` for `check`, `audit`, and `dead-code`,
  plus `includeEntryExports` config, to opt into unused public declarations in
  entry libraries while keeping Dart `main` protected
- public export-chain protection for package barrel APIs, including `show`/`hide`

- `decimate/stale-suppression` findings for unused Decimate/Fallow inline
  suppressions, with a safe remove action
- `decimate audit --base REF` changed-file gating for the existing check stack,
  including untracked new files, while keeping full-graph context before output
  scoping
- audit report scoping expands changed files by one resolved
  import/export/part/augment graph hop so directly related findings stay visible
- Fallow-style `--file PATH` report scoping for exact Dart files, keeping
  full-graph analysis while filtering JSON findings, fix previews, list
  metadata, and scoped detail arrays
- Fallow-style `--changed-since REF` report scoping that derives changed Dart
  files from Git, includes untracked files, hard-errors on invalid refs, and
  keeps full-graph analysis while filtering JSON findings and scoped detail
  arrays
- Fallow-style `--production` reachability mode for `check`, `audit`,
  `dead-code`, `trace-file`, `trace-symbol`, `list`, `workspaces`, and `fix`,
  using only production Dart entry heuristics while keeping full graph parsing;
  production dead-file findings are intentionally not auto-fixable;
  `.decimaterc` supports `production = true` and `[cli].production`, with
  `--no-production` as an explicit CLI override
- Fallow-style `--workspace` report scoping for local pub package names,
  package-root globs, comma lists, and `!` excludes, keeping full-graph analysis
  while filtering JSON findings and scoped detail arrays; `list --workspace`
  and `workspaces --workspace` filter file and package metadata
- Fallow-style `--changed-workspaces REF` report scoping that derives changed
  local pub packages from Git, hard-errors on invalid refs, is mutually
  exclusive with `--workspace`, and keeps full-graph analysis while filtering
  reports to changed package files and pubspecs
- `.decimaterc`, JSON/JSONC, and TOML config discovery with strict unknown-key
  rejection, root-relative explicit `--config`, `decimate config`,
  `decimate config-schema`, `decimate report-schema`, config-driven `format`,
  `entry`, `boundary`, Fallow-style `[boundaries]` preset/rule/coverage
  objects, `ignore_patterns`, and analyzer defaults for health, dupes, flags,
  security, plus strict `cache.enabled` / `cache.path` metadata
- config `rules` support for Fallow-style `"error"`, `"warn"`, and `"off"`
  severities, including Fallow aliases like `unused-files`, `unused-exports`,
  `unresolved-imports`, `unused-deps`, `unlisted-deps`, `circular-deps`, and
  `complexity`, plus Flutter aliases like `unused-component` and
  `unused-widget-class`
- identity baselines for `check`, `dead-code`, `cycles`, `dupes`, `health`,
  `flags`, and `security`, plus audit baseline loading for dead-code, health,
  and duplicate-code findings
- count-based regression baselines for `check`, `dead-code`, `cycles`,
  `dupes`, `health`, `flags`, and `security`, with absolute and percentage
  tolerance parsing
- Dart entry heuristics for public `lib/*.dart`, direct `bin/`, `test/`,
  `integration_test/`, `test_driver/`, `tool/`, and `pigeon/` scripts
- CLI JSON output for `check`, `audit`, `dead-code`, `cycles`, `dupes`,
  `health`, `flags`, `security`, `list`, `workspaces`, `explain`, `fix`,
  `config`, `config-schema`, and `report-schema`
- SARIF 2.1.0 output for report commands via `--format sarif`, suitable for
  code-scanning upload after the same suppression, rule, baseline, and `--top`
  filtering used by JSON reports; security `--sarif-file PATH` writes SARIF
  while keeping stdout on the selected human or JSON format; `--gate new` with
  `--changed-since`, `--diff-file`, or `--diff-stdin` narrows both JSON and
  SARIF to candidates introduced by added diff lines; security `--ci` emits
  SARIF and fails on candidates, while `--summary` keeps counts without item
  arrays for human and JSON output
